## [Excelsior Web Framework (EWF) Wiki](https://github.com/nys-its/excelsior-web-framework/wiki)

The Excelsior Web Framework (EWF) is a way to fast-track your project's user interface development. EWF is a collaboratively built front-end framework to enable NYS web projects to start on a solid mobile-first responsive foundation. The framework consists of reusable and customizable templates, styles and components. EWF is platform agnostic, yet platform ready - which allows it to be ported to multiple different platform/language templates (Drupal, Java, ColdFusion, .NET, Teamsite etc).
