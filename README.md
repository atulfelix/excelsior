The Excelsior Web Framework is a collaboratively built front-end framework to enable NYS web projects start projects on a solid mobile-first responsive foundation.  The framework consists of reusable and customizable templates, styles and components. Excelsior is platform agnostic, yet platform ready - which allows it to be ported to multiple different platform/language templates (Drupal, Java, ColdFusion, .NET, Teamsite etc).

Excelsior enables teams and projects that previously did not have front-end expertise to leverage a robust responsive framework and also allows expert developers to maintain a level of autonomy to build on top of the foundation as requirements demand.
