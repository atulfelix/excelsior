The NYS Excelsior Web Framework (EWF) is a way to fast-track your project's user interface development. It is a collaboratively built front-end framework used to enable NYS web projects to start on a solid mobile-first responsive foundation. Excelsior was built using [Zurb's Foundation framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/) as a base and also consists of customizable templates, styles, and components. It is platform agnostic, yet platform ready - which allows it to be ported to multiple different platform/language templates (Drupal, Java, ColdFusion, .NET, Teamsite etc).
